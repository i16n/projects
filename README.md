# Portfolio of projects
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Isaac H
- ðŸ‘€ I like to program and have a background in Finance (private markets -- Venture, REPE, Growth)
- ðŸŒ± This is a showcase of my projects done in & outside of my regular classes
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - here on Github (or through my resume)
  
## Overview
- matching game. A matching game (with a twist) in javascript
- sudoku for console. This was my first project in C++
- 3N+1 visualizer in Python - Input a number and view the graph it creates as it cycles through the 2 simple rules stated in the Collatz conjecture. It also provides number of "cycles" and the largest number reached. This all runs in the terminal. For this project, I implemented a recursive and iterative version of the actual 3N+1 function
- LinkedList! I wrote this after writing sudoku in C++ and realizing that it didn't really give me a good grasp on C++ manual memory management. Includes a linkedlist visualizer via a print() function, and all the regular functionality you might expect a linkedlist to have.
- website for the venture firm I am an intern at (I've been interning here for a loooong time). Their old website can be found at ugrowthfund.com. If at this point we've gone live with the new site, try waybackmachine at some point at or before 08/21/25. At this point also you can view the pre-production website at ugf-website.vercel.app. Check the project-level readme for more details, like what I learned from building it.
