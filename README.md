## Overview
- CFG parser - a context-free grammar parser that generates random "grammatically correct" sentences (used java). Submitted as final project for accelerated OOP. My partner and I were top 3 in class for runtime
- matching game. A matching game (with a twist) in javascript
- sudoku for console. This was my first project in C++
- 3N+1 visualizer in Python - Input a number and view the graph it creates as it cycles through the 2 simple rules stated in the Collatz conjecture. It also provides number of "cycles" and the largest number reached. This all runs in the terminal. For this project, I implemented a recursive and iterative version of the actual 3N+1 function
- LinkedList! I wrote this after writing sudoku in C++ and realizing that it didn't really give me a good grasp on C++ manual memory management. Includes a linkedlist visualizer via a print() function, and all the regular functionality you might expect a linkedlist to have.
