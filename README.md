# Portfolio of projects

- 👋 Hi, I’m @Isaac H
- 👀 I like to program and have a background in Finance (private markets -- Venture, Real Estate Private Equity, Growth)
- 🌱 This is a showcase of my projects done in & outside of my regular classes
- 📫 How to reach me - through info on my resume!
  
## Overview
- matching game. A matching game (with a twist) in javascript. My first project ever and first code written in javascript.
- sudoku for console. This was my first project in C++
- 3N+1 visualizer in Python - Input a number and view the graph it creates as it cycles through the 2 simple rules stated in the Collatz conjecture. It also provides number of "cycles" and the largest number reached. This all runs in the terminal. For this project, I implemented a recursive and iterative version of the actual 3N+1 function
- LinkedList! I wrote this after writing sudoku in C++ and realizing that it didn't really give me a good grasp on C++ manual memory management. Includes a linkedlist visualizer via a print() function, and all the regular functionality you might expect a linkedlist to have.
- ugf_site-snapshot: Website for the venture firm I am an intern at (I've been interning here for a loooong time). Their old website can be found at ugrowthfund.com. If at this point we've gone live with the new site, try waybackmachine at some point at or before 08/21/25. At this point also you can view the pre-production website at ugf-website.vercel.app. Check the project-level readme for more details, like what I learned from building it. At a high-level: React, TS, Nextjs, webhooks, CRON jobs, levels of caching that happen in web development, Vercel for hosting, analytics, blob storage, image optimization, APIs, revalidation, avoiding stale data, UI design (including gathering feedback from over 50 people), project management (I managed a team of 6 people, used kanban board)

## What you won't find here
This project I loved working on with a friend https://github.com/ay3xqa/kalshiXderibitTrading, where we built an automated trading bot to trade kalshi markets based on information gathered from deribit options chain, looking for discrepancies between a high-volume many-strikes marketplace and kalshi's lower-volume fewer-strike binary markets.  
  
Any work I've done relating to my internship (because it's proprietary and/or confidential) at the defense contractor Sequent Logic as a software engineer intern or my current job at Paygasus as a full-time software developer.  

My end of semester Software Practice 2 project, in C++ and using Qt. It is a little fun interface where you click around and learn about algorithms.  

My end of semester Software Practice 1 project and the mid-semester project: a simple spreadsheet and a simple snake game. Both done in C# and using C#'s new frontend tool Blazor.  
  
But anyway, a brief overview of skills acquired at these orgs:
- cypress testing  
- unix terminal (linux in general)
- jira  
- confluence  
- API design and DB schema design  
- raspberry pi work for remote JTAG debugging 
- USB/IP  
- docker (specifically docker CLI)  
- CI/CD (specifically Continuous Integration with Gitlab Runner)

## What I'm currently reading
I just finished my favorite book probably ever: _Gödel, Escher, Bach_.
I don't usually read novels, but just finished _Anna Karenina_ (Peaver and Volokhonsky translation) I loved it. I think I liked it more than _Crime and Punishment_!  
I'm now reading _The Machinery of Life_.

## Hobbies
My wife and I have 2 children, so I spend time with them in my spare time. I also love reading, learning German (currently at A1 level), and playing the violin.

## Other things about me
I'm currently a senior in university. I found a fantastic professor to work with for my Bachelor's thesis. We're doing research into memory security. Processor-level shared memory area. Very exciting stuff!
